# interactable-graph-nodes

## Project Prompt: 
Build a React app that has an interactable graph UI.
- Click on the canvas to add nodes.
- Click on existing nodes to highlight them.
- Click on the canvas again to deselect the highlighted node(s).
- Click and drag existing nodes to move where they are on the canvas.
- Some way to select 2 nodes (shift+click or a multiple select mode).
- Ability to "create a connection" between two selected nodes. The connection can be visualized somehow (a black line).
- Some way to delete nodes. Deletion should also delete any connections that start or end at that node.
